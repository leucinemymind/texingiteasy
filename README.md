## Welcome!
Hi! Hello! Welcome! It's so nice to see you here and so interested in my tiny passion project. My personal experience with LaTeX has been daunting but lovely at the same time, and that's what makes it really special. I hope that this document can make the learning process much easier on you. 

## Some things to note
I am a very passionate self-taught LaTeX enthusiast, but I am not an expert. Please do not ask me why your code isn't running, because if it is, you'd better go catch it-

I am also assuming throughout the entire document that you're a complete beginner, so please don't be offended by my use of simple language and gentle explanations of technical terms if you are actually a master TeXnician who knows exactly what they are doing! This is not meant to, as Knuth states in *The TeXbook,* please everyone at the risk of pleasing no one. You're not banned from reading it, of course, but don't be surprised if it's not quite at your level.

## The story behind it all
A little over a year ago, I read a book called ``General Relativity For Babies,'' which greatly inspired this document, so thank you, Chris Ferrie. I tried to do essentially the same thing (except with an added layer of complexity, because you are not a toddler, and treating you like one would be condescending, but if you are, that's *impressive*) with my favorite markup language, particularly because it's so useful and niche enough for people to have questions about it but not so niche that no one has ever heard of it. 

Writers of documentation generally assume that the reader is already familiar with general computing or programming concepts, and that they are only new to that particular language or tool. This was not brought to my attention before my decision to learn JavaScript, and that led to my reading documentation before reading beginner tutorials. Truthfully, they kind of look like gibberish to someone who's not experienced. As a sixth grader who had little more experience than a few coding camps, I was the epitome of ``someone who's not experienced.''

But it's amazing when you do find that one tutorial that truly helps you comprehend the language. Maybe this will be that one tutorial; maybe it won't. There's no correct answer! I will not take it personally if you decide that it is not helpful, but if you decide that it is, that's wonderful - best of luck on your journey!

## Feedback
I gratefully welcome all sorts of feedback from everyone, no matter your level of expertise! However, GitHub can be a tricky site to work with sometimes, so here's a short and sweet guide that is so short and sweet that it may compete with Sabrina Carpenter's brilliant album. If you already know how to do PRs and issues, feel free to disregard.

If you have a general suggestion, question, comment, etc., open an issue. There's a button that looks like a little target on the top. So when you open one, you can say something like

> In section 0.0, what does xyz mean?

Or you could, of course, text/email me. Whatever's easiest!

Pull requests are a little harder to do and are usually used for specific edits, but to avoid making this a very long and boring README, [learn how to make a PR here.](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

If you mess up, it's not the end of the world because the point of Git is version control! Switching between versions is very easy and if you accidentally, say, deleted the entire document and pushed that, it's not a problem at all. (Probably. Knock on wood just to be safe.)

## Conclusion
Have lots of fun! You got this :)

Love,

Your non-denominational sister in TeX
